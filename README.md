## EDA

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Feature Selection
- Removed columns with all null values (278 columns).
- Replaced null and outlier values ('OK') with 0 in certain columns (e.g., HEAD NORMAL COORDINATE X AXIS(Stage1) Collect Result_Dam).
- Deleted columns with only a single unique value (40 columns).
- Identified and removed redundant columns with high correlation, retaining only one, using a correlation coefficient with a threshold of 0.94.
  
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Upsampling
- class imbalance of train data with an AbNormal to Normal ratio of 0.06:1.
- utilized SMOTENC to address this imbalance through upsampling.
- upsampled AbNormal data to reach half the quantity of Normal data.
- downsampled Normal data to equal the amount of augmented AbNormal data.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Rule Discovery
- Analyzed groups of common columns and discovered several rules:
  - If any Equipment_xxx differs, it is classified as AbNormal.
  - If any Production Qty Collect Result_xxx differs, it is classified as AbNormal.
  - If any Receip No Collect Result_xxx differs, it is classified as AbNormal.
- Considered two methods for handling these rules:
  - Add columns indicating rule satisfaction and proceed with training.
  - Post-training, hardcode to classify as AbNormal if rules are satisfied.
- Experimental results showed that the second method outperformed the first, leading to its final adoption.
